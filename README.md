# Credit_Card_Segmentation
Customer segmentation is an important topic for many industries and the credit card industry is no exception. All customers are never the same. Their needs can be complex to unravel and more importantly, those needs evolve. Businesses are faced with the challenge of identifying the ever-evolving complex web of needs of customers in order to tailor services to them. This has become very important for businesses to stay competitive.  The existence of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms among other powerful modern technologies have made it possible to understand customers on a large scale and more importantly develop and tailor marketing campaigns, products and services to the right market segment. In this paper, the author uses KMeans, Agglomerative and Spectral clustering to segment credit card customers into four segments. Within each profile segment, the author notes their characteristics and further recommend marketing strategies for each of the profile segment.
